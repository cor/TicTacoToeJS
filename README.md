TicTacoToeJS
============

A Javascript version of my TicTacoToe game.

[The original TicTacoToe game](https://github.com/CorPruijs/TicTacoToe) is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Java that uses the console.

This is pretty much the same game, except that it looks a lot better.
It's entirely client side, made using simple JS and jQuery
